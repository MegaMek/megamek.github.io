# Welcome all to 0.49.14

This release is a one of the largest releases for fixes and new features that we've done in quite a while. There are numerous bug fixes in all three programs, data wise we've added a few more units, few new sprites and updates and new boards. But the exciting stuff is a huge new Stratcon Feature, and lots of QOL stuff in MegaMek. Plus it can print Record Sheets again.  cheesy

### Lets talk about Simultaneous (Sim) stuff

Last release we created a bit of a storm with the comments around Sim Phases and their future. Guess what...we think we have a fix for them.

But we want to be specific about a few things. If this fix works then the only one **_likely_** on the chopping block is Sim Movement. It's not coded well and doesn't follow TT rules used in Double Blind. So lets say this another way.....Sim Deployment, Sim Targeting, Sim Firing, and Sim Physical will **_likely_** stay. Notice a key word in the last few sentences **_"likely"_** as defined by Merriam-Webster _"having a high probability of occurring or being true : very probable"._

What we would like players to do is test the fix in this release. Go back to using Sim Phases (try to avoid Sim Move). We are looking specifically for instances where a [u]player gets there turned skipped[/u]. If you want to help with this make sure to turn on "Paranoid Autosave" we'd need save games to continue to track down the issue.

## MegaMekLab

Lots of fixes, and improvements to reporting BV and Alpha Conversion reports. We also fixed our packing opps in 49.13 and we can print Record Sheets again.

We are aware of an intermittent issue (won't run) with the _**stand alone**_ MegaMekLab release and Linux. If you have issues please use the full MekHQ release to get a working MegaMekLab.

## MekHQ
Has had some bug fixes, but the one...and for one of the coolest (in our opinion) features for Stratcon.

### Stratcon Advanced Terrain Update

Tired of looking at the same gray hexes and square boxes while tactical battles take place only on generic grasslands terrain? With this update, that will be a thing of the past.

A note on features:

+ Each track now has an average temperature that is transferred to MegaMek.
+ The track's temperature determines which biomes may appear on the track.
+ Each hex has its own biome which determines what tactical maps appear in MegaMek.[/li]
+ The random map generator has been upgraded with a lot of new terrain possibilities. Fight in deep jungles, frozen wastelands or obnoxiously short foliage forests.
+ [Awesome biome and facility graphics thanks to Florian "SpOoKy777" Mellies.](https://www.sarna.net/wiki/Florian_Mellies)

_**This part is critically important!!! You must finish up your current contract/mission before updating versions.**_

**A few reminders of things.**

1. We have made changes to the unit files to align them with the MUL by removing the term "(Standard)". This was a significant data task and resulted in the removal of nearly 1000 instances of "(Standard)". Our Quality Assurance (QA) team has thoroughly tested these name changes by creating campaigns and loading them with every unit. However, there is a potential risk in MekHQ with CPNX files, as they rely on unit names for matching. If you encounter any errors while loading your campaign file, we apologize for the inconvenience and kindly refer to the [following post](https://github.com/MegaMek/megamek/wiki/Name-Issues-with-Units) for further assistance.

2. Lastly weâ€™ve ripped the unofficial unit band aid off. We've moved the unofficial units zip out of this release. The reasons and poll for this was [discussed here](https://bg.battletech.com/forums/megamek-games/how-often-do-you-use-the-units-from-the-unsupported-or-unofficial-folders/). Between our Discord and this poll 75% of players were good with us removing them. It allows us to have the releases be focused on canon units.

The file is still available but players will need to add the zip file manually. We have no plans to further support or add units into that zip. It would be safe to just set it up in a customs folder and move that folder between releases.

To add the units back:

1. Download the zip file from the [MegaMek Extras](https://github.com/MegaMek/megamek-extras/tree/master/data/mechfiles).
2. You need to right click and use the "Save link as"
3. Save this as a zip to the data\mechfiles folder of the program.
     -As a suggestion save this to a customs folder in the data\mechfiles
4. On restart they will be added.

Remember that MekHQ campaign files **aren't** backwards compatible so if move your campaign from an earlier version to this you can't go back. But you can keep backups and play in both versions to see the difference.

See the notes above and below for specific things.

### MekHQ StratCon Alpha

See the big news above!!

## Stable 0.50.0 Status Update

We are still in the development portion of the current cycle. We've been able to implement a new version of Gradle (our build language) starting with the 0.49.11 release. As well as adding support for Java 17. This is still undergoing testing and we encourage players to use the programs with Java 17 but Java 11 remains our recommended choice for the .49.x Dev cycle. We are still working on the connection stability issues and are hopeful this release is the first step on the road to a fix.

We are getting to a point where we are starting to talk about 0.50.0 Stable but we still have some significant things we need to complete and don't anticipate a new Stable anytime soon. At this point we have some really good solid development releases and for security alone I'd recommend upgrading to Java 11 from Java 8.

## Java 11 and Java 17

We've updated to Java 11, which means you'll need to update to use the [b]0.49.x development branches[/b]. As Java is now open source, we recommend [url=https://adoptium.net/index.html?variant=openjdk11]Adoptium Temurin 11[/url]. We have a help page [url=https://github.com/MegaMek/megamek/wiki/Updating-to-Adoptium]for Windows[/url] and [url=https://megamek.org/wiki/mac_issues.html]Mac[/url]. Further, for Linux, you should be able to use your package manager to install Adoptium Temurin from their repository. Finally, all our automated tests (with the exception of MegaMekLab) are done with Temurin 11.

This release implements support for Java 17. We need to stress this has had some testing and needs more players to use the programs with Java 17. But Java 11 remains our recommended version.

## Social Media

We are also happy to announce we have an [official MegaMek Discord](https://discord.gg/u2vJ5U2QpD). This is now our primary community location for the suite, providing superior voice support, individual channels, and assistance for the [official public servers](https://megamek.games).  There are also the following community Discords with regular MegaMek channels, namely [Everything BattleTech](https://discord.gg/gyXMWjT) and [Classic BattleTech](https://discord.gg/D9jFn52). We are also on Facebook, at [MegaMek BattleTech](https://www.facebook.com/groups/5124394675) and [MegaMek](https://www.facebook.com/MegaMek) for our group and page respectively.

## Mac Users

[Please](https://megamek.org/wiki/mac_issues.html) check out this workaround for Mac Operating Systems.

## Contributing

[Please](https://megamek.org/wiki/I-want-to-help) check out this document for contributing to the suite. Deadborder has us covered from land unit sprites and camos. But we desperately need sprites for aerospace units.

## Updating Your Campaign

1. Make backups of your campaigns and customs.
2. Always treat each release as a stand alone release and only copy your data forward from older versions, never backwards.
3. Do not copy MegaMek saves nor any preference file from a different version.
