# Technical Stuff and Social Media

## Java 17 is **Required** for all 0.50.x Releases

---

Starting with version 0.50.0-Development, Java 17 will be **REQUIRED** to play. We‚Äôve updated our guide to [Updating to Adoptium (Eclipse Temurin Open Source Java)](https://github.com/MegaMek/megamek/wiki/Updating-to-Adoptium-(Eclipse-Temurin-Open-Source-Java)) with more detailed instructions.

It‚Äôs crucial to read the directions carefully, especially Step 6, which covers a recent change to the Adoptium installer. Make sure to select ‚ÄúInstall for all users of this machine‚Äù in the Installation Scope.

We will continue using Java 17 until Fall 2026. If you choose to use a Java version beyond 17, it isn‚Äôt officially supported, and our standard response for issues will be to revert to Java 17. We recommend upgrading to Java 17 before the new release; if you are running 0.49.12-Development or later, it will run on Java 17.

## User Data Directory for MegaMek, MegaMekLab, and MekHQ

We've added a customizable **User Data Directory** feature. This allows you to set a single external directory for storing game resources like units, camos, and fonts, which is accessible across different installations and versions of MegaMek, MegaMekLab, and MekHQ.

### Key Points:

- **Set a Custom Directory**: Choose any location on your computer (e.g., `D:/myMMStuff`) to keep your game resources.

- **File Placement**:

    - Fonts and units (.mtf, .blk) can be placed anywhere within this directory.

    - Camo images in `/data/images/camo/`.

    - Portrait images in `/data/images/portraits/`.

    - Unit fluff images in `/data/images/fluff/<unit type>/`.

    - Rank and award definition files (.xml) in `/data/universe/`.

- **Consistent Access**: Resources in this directory are usable across different game versions and modules without needing to relocate them for each new install.

- **Implementation**: Set up this directory via the client settings. A game restart is required for changes to take effect.

## Important: MekHQ Campaign Update Instructions

It is critical to follow these steps to ensure the integrity of your MekHQ campaign when updating between versions. Failure to follow these steps can result in the corruption of your campaign file.

Treat each release as stand-alone; **Copy, never Move** your data forward from older versions. MekHQ is **NOT** backward compatible.

1. You **MUST** complete all ongoing contracts in your current campaign, save, and exit the program.

2. **Make a backup of your campaign and custom files. This is a critical step to prevent data loss!**

3. **DO NOT COPY** MegaMek saves or any preference file from a different version to avoid compatibility issues.

4. Update MekHQ to the latest version. **NEVER** overwrite the existing folder; always keep each version in its own folder.

5. In the new version, load your save file in MekHQ and advance the game by one day.

6. Re-save any custom presets to ensure they are updated with the new version's settings.

7. Exit MekHQ and restart the application to complete the update process.

Following these steps will ensure that your campaign data initializes correctly and avoids potential issues. This process is essential for maintaining campaign stability.
