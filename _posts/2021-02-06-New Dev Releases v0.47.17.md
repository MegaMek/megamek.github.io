Hi Everyone,

We are pleased to announce the release of Release Candidate 2 for the 0.48.0 Stable. If all goes well we are hoping for new stable to be out end of January. Then we'll start into the 0.49.x Development cycle. 

Just a heads up when we hit that milestone we'll be moving all three of the programs to Java 11. This means you'll need to update Java to run in the next development cycle. Lots of players are starting to update and we've got a wiki page to help. Players with high DPI and 4k monitors have noticed a big improvement using Megamek after updating. We'll provide more details on this when we hit the development cycle.

There are also some great video tutorials by StrategosLevel3 for Megamek available [HERE.](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHXHV2JDcebr4J3VyJlmU-Yp3cZp_OhWV)

As always when using a Development release.
1)  Make backups of your campaigns and customs.
2)  Always treat each release as a stand alone release and only copy your data forward from older versions.

**Megamek**<br/>
Bug fixes is the name of the game. Also a lot of data fixes and a couple of surprise early additions.

**MegaMekLab**<br/>
Bug fixes.

**MekHQ.**<br/>
Bug fixes.

For a detailed change log see [HERE](https://bg.battletech.com/forums/megamek-games/new-development-snapshot-0-47-17-rc3-for-megamek-megameklab-and-mekhq/)

Also a reminder to drop into the Slack channel to meet other players and harass the Devs that drop in and out. If Slack isn't your thing check out these Discords with Megamek channels - Everything BattleTech and Classic BattleTech

**FOR MAC USERS**
We think we now have a workaround for Macs.  See [HERE](https://megamek.org/wiki/mac_issues.html) for details.

Another reminder when moving between versions:<br/>
1)  Make backups of your campaigns and customs.<br/>
2)  Always treat each release as a stand alone release and only copy your data forward from older versions.
