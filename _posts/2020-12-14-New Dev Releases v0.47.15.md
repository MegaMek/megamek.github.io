Hi Everyone,

We are pleased to announce the release of Release Candidate 1 for the 0.48.0 Stable. If all goes well we are hoping for new stable to be out in January. Then we'll start into the 0.49.x Development cycle. 

Just a heads up when we hit that milestone we'll be moving all three of the programs to Java 11. This means you'll need to update Java to run in the next development cycle. Lots of players are starting to update and we've got a wiki page to help. Players with high DPI and 4k monitors have noticed a big improvement using Megamek after updating. We'll provide more details on this when we hit the development cycle.

As always when using a Development release.
1)  Make backups of your campaigns and customs.
2)  Always treat each release as a stand alone release and only copy your data forward from older versions.

**Megamek**<br/>
Bug fixes is the name of the game. The only major new thing is adding an option to output game summary images during various phases. See the coming soon post [here](https://bg.battletech.com/forums/megamek-games/coming-soon-to-megamek/msg1673607/#msg1673607). We look forward to seeing what people come up. But a word of warning, this is hard drive space intensive and off by default.

**MegaMekLab**<br/>
Bug fixes.

**MekHQ.**<br/>
Lots of bug fixes with ammo bugs getting lots attention. We've been working on improving performance. We are also working on improving refits but that's still a work in progress.

Also a reminder to drop into the Slack channel to meet other players and harass the Devs that drop in and out. If Slack isn't your thing check out these Discords with Megamek channels - Everything BattleTech and Classic BattleTech

**FOR MAC USERS**
There isn't a Mac release and you'll have to use the Unix release. We are having issues with the Gradle packaging scripts and various security settings in MacOS.  We are working on the issue and have no ETA for a fix.

Another reminder when moving between versions:<br/>
1)  Make backups of your campaigns and customs.<br/>
2)  Always treat each release as a stand alone release and only copy your data forward from older versions.

If you get errors loading your campaign as result of unit name errors please see this post. [Name Issues with units](https://github.com/MegaMek/megamek/wiki/Name-Issues-with-Units)
