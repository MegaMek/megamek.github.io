Hi Everyone,
About a month since our last dev release and we had some nasty bugs in 0.47.5 for MekHQ. Those should be fixed for this version.

#### MegaMek
We got bug fixes. Abandon ship! Large spacecraft can now launch escape pods, giving the opposing player more opportunity to commit war crimes. Princess has also gone back for a couple of combat classes at flight school and learned that turrets should be mounted on the top floor to be more effective. A ton of new sprites (Thanks Deadborder and Saxarba). Speaking of Saxarba we've made his tileset (we were using Atmospheric) the official default tileset of MegaMek.

#### New official Tileset (Saxarba Tileset)

#### Old Default Tileset - Atmospheric

If you want to explore and experiment with themes and other graphic options they are under View-Client Settings-Graphics

Also changing the theme under View-Change Tileset theme can had a feel of seasons to the Tilesets.

#### MegaMekLab
In a word bug fixes and one feature - overhauled Battle Armor Record Sheet printing.

#### MekHQ.
For MekHQ we've got a chunk of bug fixes and a few QoL new features. See the impact of the war crimes in Abandon ship! first hand in MekHQ. 

**FOR MAC USERS**
There isn't a Mac release and you'll have to use the Unix release. We are having issues with the Gradle packaging scripts and various security settings in MacOS. We are working on the issue and have no ETA for a fix.

You can get them [here](https://megamek.org/downloads.html)
