# The Cost of Choosing Sides in 50.07

> “Caesar Julius O'Reilly was a man of ambition, not conviction. He wore our gifts like a laurel crown, paraded our wisdom as if it were his birthright, and whispered false prayers to Jerome Blake when it suited his Senate's applause. He took what we offered—‘Meks, knowledge, power—and then dared to imagine himself free of the debt owed. Worse, he believed he could turn his legions against the hand that raised them.”
>
> “So we reminded the Hegemony, and all who watched from their trembling thrones, what betrayal costs. Let the marble columns of Nova Roma stand silent as tombstones. Let the ashes of Senate and Caesar choke the skies. Our message is clear: There is no Rome without Blake, and there is no salvation for those who forget their place.”

## Introducing the Faction Standings System

In 50.07 we are proud to introduce one of our most ambitious features yet: the **Faction Standings** system—a dynamic, persistent web of loyalties, grudges, and political memory that tracks your campaign’s standing with every major power in the galaxy.

From now on, who you fight for—and who you betray—matters.

### What Is Faction Standing?

Faction Standing is your individual relationship with every major House, minor Periphery state, Clan, and mercenary board. It’s distinct from Force Reputation (which measures your overall professional prestige). Faction Standing is about trust, loyalty, and politics.

After all, you can be the best mercenary unit in the business and still be hated.

  />
</div>

### Standing Is Always Shifting

Faction Standing—measured in **Regard**, from **-60** (hated) to **+60** (beloved)—changes based on:

- Who you take contracts from
- Who you fight against
- Whether you execute POWs
- Whether you refuse a Clan Batchall
- Whether you defect, go rogue, or fail missions
- And much more

Contracts don’t just pay bills—they change your political reality.

</div>

### Climate Regard: Politics Move Without You

The galaxy doesn’t wait. Over time, each faction’s attitude toward your campaign will evolve based on lore events, from the Ronin War to the FedCom Civil War. That means your reputation may rise or fall just by surviving the times.

  />
</div>

### Ultimatums: Choose a Side or Pay the Price

Certain historical events will now force your hand.

**Ultimatums**—major turning points like the Amaris Coup, the ComStar Schism, or the FedCom Civil War—where neutrality isn’t an option.  
Ultimatums create permanent consequences for your campaign’s political path, and in some cases, your survival.

Your unit may win the battle… but lose its soul.

## Accolades, Censures, and Going Rogue

### Accolades

Earned by consistent support, Accolades range from cash bonuses to propaganda reels, even free ‘Meks, public statues, and messages from Heads of State.

### Censures

Fall out of favor and you’ll face escalating consequences: fines, leadership purges, imprisonments… even campaign‑ending disbandment.

### Going Rogue

Change sides? Defect? Turn pirate? Your loyal crew might abandon you—or die in the transition. Your old faction will wipe your reputation and blacklist you. And your campaign’s narrative will change forever.

## Impacts Across the System

Your Standing Level (1–9) directly affects:

- **Negotiation**: contract clause modifiers
- **StratCon Resupply**: bigger drops for better Standing
- **Command Circuit Access**: faster travel for loyal units
- **Outlaw Status**: get locked out of hostile territory
- **Recruitment**: faction favor boosts applicant quantity
- **Unit Market**: better gear from friendlier factions
- **Contract Pay**: slight pay bump for trusted units
- **StratCon Support Points**: more Support Points from friends in high places

## Special Campaigns: Mercs & Pirates

**Mercenary Campaigns** evolve through eras, shifting oversight from the MRB to MRBC to Clan Sea Fox’s MBA.

**Pirate Campaigns** use the “Piracy Success Index” instead of standard factions—and risk legal crackdown if they lose momentum.

## You Wanted Impact? You Got It.

With Faction Standings, your campaign is no longer just a string of missions—it’s a career, a legacy, a reputation that follows you system to system, faction to faction.

Choose your friends wisely. Betrayal has consequences. And loyalty? Loyalty just might get you a statue.

## FAQ

### What is Faction Standing?

Faction Standing is your relationship with each major faction in the BattleTech universe. It tracks how much they trust, respect, or despise your unit based on your actions across the campaign.

It’s not the same as Force Reputation—which is about your overall professionalism. Faction Standing is personal, political, and persistent.

### How is Faction Standing measured?

Standing is tracked as **Regard**, a score from -60 (hated) to +60 (highly trusted). That Regard score translates into Standing Levels (1–9) which determine mechanical effects across the campaign.

### How do I raise or lower my Standings?

Your Standing changes when you:

- Take contracts for or against a faction
- Succeed or fail missions
- Refuse or accept key scenario options (e.g., murdering POWs, defying Ultimatums)
- Commit piracy or betrayal
- Refuse a Clan Batchall
- Go Rogue

Even inaction can shift standings if political climates change.

### What is “Climate Regard”?

Climate Regard is the faction’s attitude toward other factions in general, based on in‑universe lore and historical events. It can shift over time (via date triggers) regardless of your personal behavior. Examples:

- The Draconis Combine hates mercenaries after the 4th Succession War.
- The Lyrans hate the Federated Suns during the Civil War.
- Some Periphery factions flip polarity based on internal coups.

### What are Ultimatums?

Ultimatums are critical historical moments where you must choose a side—like The Exodus or Espinosa Coup. They’re branching events with long‑term consequences and replay value.

### What happens if I betray a faction or go rogue?

You’ll trigger a Reputation Reset with that faction and may:

- Lose loyal personnel
- Get banned from that faction’s systems
- Take standing hits with allied factions
- Become a Pirate, Outlaw, or Hunted

### How do Pirate campaigns work?

Pirates use the Piracy Success Index (PSI) instead of normal faction standings. You gain PSI by successfully completing pirate contracts. Lose PSI, and you’ll attract legal heat or collapse internally.

### Can I repair my bad Standing?

Sometimes—slowly. To rebuild trust:

- Stop antagonizing the faction and take their contracts
- Wait it out: time heals all wounds.

### Where can I see my current Standing?

- Open the **Faction Standings Report** in MekHQ
- Hover over a faction to view the unique effects for that faction
- Watch out for Censure, Accolade, or Ultimatum events
