"For the soldiers who had fought for Amaris, the prospect of captivity was not as terrifying as what came after. They could not fathom how they might ever walk free again, how they could return to a world that saw them as traitors and butchers. How could they step into the light of day and pretend to be ordinary men once more? How could they look their fellow Terrans in the eye after the orders they had followed, the cities they had burned, the executions they had carried out? It was not the grand betrayals or the battlefield horrors that haunted them most, but the small, everyday things—the idea of sitting at a café table without fear, of hearing laughter without flinching, of touching a white linen cloth with hands that had only known the grip of a rifle. The great crimes of war could be hidden behind ideology, but in the quiet moments, when there was nothing left but memory, there was no place to hide."

## A New Era in Prisoner Management

We've taken the solid foundation of the Campaign Operations rules and evolved them into a more dynamic, interactive system. Rather than simply rehashing familiar mechanics, we've introduced innovative elements like Prisoner Capacity Events, Temporary Prisoner Capacity modifiers, and a new Security TO&E role. With multiple capture styles available, you can customize your experience to suit your play style and the level of complexity you're after, ensuring that every campaign feels uniquely challenging.

    }
  </style>

## Dynamic Capacity and Temporary Modifiers

At the core of this update is a new, dynamic prisoner capacity system. In the classic Campaign Operations mode, capacity is a fixed number based on your security personnel. But with the MekHQ capture style, capacity becomes a living part of your campaign—responsive to the condition of your holding facilities and the morale of your guards. Add in Temporary Prisoner Capacity, which introduces hidden modifiers from events like mass executions, and you have a system that can shift on a dime, keeping you engaged as you balance the ups and downs of managing your prisoners.

    }

## Search and Rescue

One of the most exciting additions is our abstracted Search and Rescue system. While we're not ready to implement a full SAR system, instead, we've condensed what would normally take three days into a quick, dice-driven resolution. Whether you're fighting on the ground or in the depths of space, unique modifiers ensure that every rescue attempt is tailored to the situation at hand. And if a character is physically picked up during combat, their capture is guaranteed, adding a satisfying sense of immediacy to your operations.

## Processing Captured Personnel

After the battle, captured personnel go through a processing phase that adapts to different factions and capture styles. For example, within Clan factions, prisoners might be converted into Bondsmen—a transformation influenced by both their background and a bit of chance. Meanwhile, unexpected twists like defections can occur, keeping the narrative as unpredictable as war itself. Each step in this process is designed to reflect the complex realities of prisoner treatment, where every decision carries both narrative and strategic weight.

    }
  </style>

## Dynamic Events and Ransom Opportunities

Under the MekHQ capture style, the battlefield becomes even more unpredictable with dynamic events that breathe life into prisoner management. From internal disputes and hunger strikes to full-blown riots and fires, these events keep you constantly engaged. When your prisoner count exceeds capacity, you'll receive timely warnings, giving you the option to free or execute a portion of your captives—each choice coming with its own set of consequences. And with occasional ransom events, you might even get a chance to recover your own captured characters or turn enemy prisoners into a financial advantage.

Dive into this update, embrace the complexity, and let your command be defined by the choices you make in the unforgiving theater of war. Enjoy the challenge and watch your decisions echo across the galaxy.
