<h2>Hi Everyone,</h2>
<p>
  Welcome to 0.50.02; this is another massive release. With so much code comes
  challenges: while fixing bugs, modernizing code, and introducing new
  features, new issues can emerge. We anticipate the next few releases will
  have some issues, but don't let that deter you from using the
  releases—just remember to keep backups of your files. In fact, we encourage
  you to use this release to help us find and squash the bugs!

<h1>Technical Stuff and Social Media</h1>

<hr>

<h2>Java 17 is <strong>Required</strong> for all 0.50.x Releases</h2>
<p>
  Starting with version 0.50.0-Development, Java 17 will be
  <strong>REQUIRED</strong> to play. We’ve updated our guide to
  <a href="https://github.com/MegaMek/megamek/wiki/Updating-to-Adoptium-(Eclipse-Temurin-Open-Source-Java)">Updating
  to Adoptium (Eclipse Temurin Open Source Java)</a> with more detailed
  instructions.
</p>
<p>
  It’s crucial to read the directions carefully, especially Step 6, which
  covers a recent change to the Adoptium installer. Make sure to select
  “Install for all users of this machine” in the Installation Scope.
</p>
<p>
  We will continue using Java 17 until Fall 2026. If you choose to use a Java
  version beyond 17, it isn’t officially supported, and our standard response
  for issues will be to revert to Java 17. We recommend upgrading to Java 17
  before the new release; if you are running 0.49.12-Development or later, it
  will run on Java 17.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>User Data Directory for MegaMek, MegaMekLab, and MekHQ</h2>
<p>
  We’ve added a customizable <strong>User Data Directory</strong> feature. This
  allows you to set a single external directory for storing game resources like
  units, camos, and fonts, which is accessible across different installations
  and versions of MegaMek, MegaMekLab, and MekHQ.
</p>

<h3>Key Points:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Set a Custom Directory:</strong> Choose any location on your
    computer (e.g., <code>D:/myMMStuff</code>) to keep your game resources.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>File Placement:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Fonts and units (.mtf, .blk) can be placed anywhere within this directory.</li>
      <li>Camo images in <code>/data/images/camo/</code>.</li>
      <li>Portrait images in <code>/data/images/portraits/</code>.</li>
      <li>Unit fluff images in <code>/data/images/fluff/&lt;unit type&gt;/</code>.</li>
      <li>Rank and award definition files (.xml) in <code>/data/universe/</code>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Consistent Access:</strong> Resources in this directory are usable
    across different game versions and modules without needing to relocate them
    for each new install.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Implementation:</strong> Set up this directory via the client
    settings. A game restart is required for changes to take effect.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Important: MekHQ Campaign Update Instructions</h2>
<p>
  It is critical to follow these steps to ensure the integrity of your MekHQ
  campaign when updating between versions. Failure to follow these steps can
  result in the corruption of your campaign file.
</p>
<p>
  Treat each release as stand-alone; <strong>Copy, never Move</strong> your
  data forward from older versions. MekHQ is <strong>NOT</strong> backward
  compatible.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    You <strong>MUST</strong> complete all ongoing contracts in your current
    campaign, save, and exit the program.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Make a backup</strong> of your campaign and custom files. This is a
    critical step to prevent data loss!
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>DO NOT COPY</strong> MegaMek saves or any preference file from a
    different version to avoid compatibility issues.
  </li>
  <li>
    Update MekHQ to the latest version. <strong>NEVER</strong> overwrite the
    existing folder; always keep each version in its own folder.
  </li>
  <li>
    In the new version, load your save file in MekHQ and advance the game by
    one day.
  </li>
  <li>
    Re-save any custom presets to ensure they are updated with the new version's
    settings.
  </li>
  <li>
    Exit MekHQ and restart the application to complete the update process.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  Following these steps will ensure that your campaign data initializes
  correctly and avoids potential issues. This process is essential for
  maintaining campaign stability.
