# Overhauling Recruitment in 50.07

> "I was just a raw recruit when we landed on McComb during the War of 3039. I was proud to wear the crest of the 
> Martian Cuirassiers, but I had barely learned to march in formation, let alone pilot a 'Mek in combat."
> 
> "But war does not wait. The sky turned to fire, the ground trembled with the fury of battle, and men I had trained 
> withâ€”laughed withâ€”were gone in an instant. Nearly forty percent of us never left that world."
> 
> "Standing in the wreckage, watching the last embers fade, I learned my first and hardest lesson: life is fragile, 
> fleeting, and far too precious to waste."

## Introducing the 2.0 Personnel Market

War is brutal. Units are shattered. MekWarriors fall. But the mission continuesâ€”and that means one thing: recruitment.

In version 50.07, MekHQ will be introducing a completely overhauled personnel market system, designed to bring 
BattleTechâ€™s gritty realism and strategic depth to your campaignâ€™s most human element: its people.

### Why We Changed It

The old recruitment system was too frequent, too generous, and too disconnected from the BattleTech universe. 
Players could game the system, bypass meaningful character development, build elite rosters with little effort, or 
were left missing critical professionsâ€”such as Administrators.

Our goals were clear:
- Add role coverage for every position your unit needs
- Make recruitment more strategic, not just routine
- Ensure recruit quality matches your unitâ€™s rep
- Tie recruitment to location, faction, and politics
- Stop professions appearing before theyâ€™re meant to. Looking at you, 3025 Inner Sphere ProtoMek Pilotsâ€¦

### Three Markets, Three Playstyles

Choose how deep you want to go:

- **MekHQ Market** â€” Fully immersive, location-based recruitment. Hiring halls, population size, faction 
  reputation, and planetary control all influence whoâ€™s available and how often. The most lore-rich and strategic option.
- **CamOps (Revised)** â€” A tweaked version of Campaign Operations rules that adds missing professions. Ideal for 
  players who want rules-faithful gameplay without losing role coverage.
- **CamOps (Strict)** â€” True to the rulebookâ€”no frills, no fixes. Includes fewer professions. Hardcore only.

    style="width: 100%; height: auto;"
  />
</div>

### Monthly Rolls, Meaningful Choices

Recruitment now happens once per month, not daily. At monthâ€™s end, a pool of recruits is generated based on:
- System modifiers (e.g., Great Hiring Hall in a faction capital = x4 attempts)
- Faction Standing
- Population size
- Commander Connections trait

Strategic travel and downtime between contracts just became essential.

    style="width: 100%; height: auto;"
  />
</div>

### Reputation Matters

You want Elite recruits? Earn them. High-skill applicants wonâ€™t join a green merc unit. Recruit quality is now tied 
to your **Campaign Ops Reputation**, with odds scaling up only as your unit proves itself in battle.

You can sweeten the deal by offering a Golden Helloâ€”one yearâ€™s salary upfront. This increases your chances of 
attracting better applicants without breaking game balance.

## Dependents, Diversity & Personality

Each month also brings Dependentsâ€”untrained hopefuls looking for a shot. Theyâ€™re perfect for players who invest in 
education and development.

Recruits now come with interviewer notes, offering a glimpse into their personalities and loyalty. No more 
automatically knowing a recruitâ€™s deepest secrets.

## Smarter Recruitment, Deeper Campaigns

This system isnâ€™t just about who you hireâ€”itâ€™s about how you plan:
- Need a MekTech? Better travel to a populated world with a Hiring Hall.
- Low on Infantry? Make time between contracts to scout new blood.
- Want rare specialists like LAM pilots or Hyperspace Navigators? Keep your eyes peeledâ€”they're in there... but rare 
  for a reason.

## Ready to Recruit?

Whether you're rebuilding from losses or expanding for your next contract, hiring the right people has never 
mattered more. And remember: a good â€˜Mek is just scrap without the right pilot.

## FAQ

### Why did you change recruitment at all?

The old system let players recruit elite characters too easily, didnâ€™t respect faction or location, lacked critical 
professions, and was poorly documented. This new system fixes thatâ€”making recruitment more strategic, immersive, and 
balanced.

### Whatâ€™s the difference between MekHQ, CamOps (Revised), and CamOps (Strict)?

- **MekHQ**: Fully featured. Location-based, faction-aware, and supports every role. Best choice for most players.
- **CamOps (Revised)**: Based on official rules but patched to include all key roles (like Administrators).
- **CamOps (Strict)**: Straight-up rules-as-written. Missing roles like LAM pilots. Only use if youâ€™re a hardcore 
  stickler for Campaign Ops.

### When do new recruits show up?

At the end of each month. The number of applicants is based on:

- Days in the month (28â€“31)
- Multipliers from Hiring Halls, Capital status, Faction Standing, and Connections trait

### Can I recruit while on contract?

Only if itâ€™s a Garrison-type contract (anything ending in "Duty" except "Relief Duty"). Otherwise, you must be 
stationed planetside and off-mission to hire.

### Why canâ€™t I find high-experience recruits?

Your unitâ€™s reputation limits who will consider joining. If you're rated Regular, donâ€™t expect Elite or Heroic 
applicants to line up. Youâ€™ve got to earn your reputation on the battlefield.

### Whatâ€™s a Golden Hello?

Itâ€™s a signing bonusâ€”1 yearâ€™s salary paid only if you hire the recruit. While active, it improves the odds that 
higher-experience characters will show interest.

### What are Dependents? Should I care?

Dependents are unskilled applicants. Theyâ€™re great for:

- Players who invest in the Education system
- Campaigns that need cheap labor or future specialists
- Storytelling and roleplaying value

Ignore them if you want ready-made recruits. Develop them if you're playing the long game.

### What determines a recruitâ€™s profession or origin?

Itâ€™s based on your faction, your campaign era, and the factions present in the system. Each faction gets "tickets" 
in the recruitment draw. Allies and your own faction get more. Pirates and Mercs always have a chance to show up.

### What happens if I have a negative CamOps Reputation?

If your Campaign Ops Reputation drops below -25, only Pirates and Mercs will consider joining you.

### Where can I check how many recruitment rolls Iâ€™m getting?

- Open the Interstellar Map to check Hiring Hall and Capital status
- Check system data for population
- Check your Connections trait and Faction Standing

Alternatively, you can check the personnel market to see a handy slider. That will give you a good idea of how 
valuable recruiting in a given system is.

### Can I still use the old system?

Yesâ€”for now. But the legacy systems will be deprecated in future releases. MekHQâ€™s new market is now the standard.
