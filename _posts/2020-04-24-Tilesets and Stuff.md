MegaMek actually has quite a few different Tilesets that change the look of the game. We are currently looking at changing our default Tileset to the Saxarba Tileset.

#### Current Tileset - Atmospheric

#### Saxarba Tileset - Saxarba

As you can see it's quite the difference. If you've ever wanted to see samples of all the Tilesets we've got some more screenshots here:

#### BW Atmospheric - A variant on Atmospheric

#### Classic - Styled on the original Table Top maps

#### Isometric - Similar to Atmospheric but optimized for Isometric play

#### Large Texture - Designed to spread a base image over a larger area

We also have some HQ tilesets which will tax MegaMek unless extra memory has been allocated to MegaMek. Even then it might not help.

#### HQ Atmospheric

If you want to explore and experiment with themes and other graphic options they are under View-Client Settings-Graphics

Also changing the theme under View-Change Tileset theme can had a feel of seasons to the Tilesets.

This is teaser of another Tileset we are looking into.
