Hi Everyone,

So it's been a few months since the last dev release, and this one is going to be huge! Lots of new cool stuff. So I remind everyone this is development release and all this new goodness means LOTS of chances of bugs. So make sure you keep backups of your games.

**FOR MAC USERS**
There isn't a Mac release and you'll have to use the Unix release. We are having issues with the Gradle packaging scripts and various security settings in MacOS. We are working on the issue and have no ETA for a fix.

MegaMek.
Lots of bug fixes that will carry over into MegaMekLab. Princess has learned to turn the lights on when fighting at night. We've got new maps from Derv and Simon Landmine. But the biggie is Support Vees. A huge amount of work has gone into MegaMek to support the building of Support Vehicles. This is the first step in getting some new unit types playable. Soon you'll be able to have the Great Train Robbery with a Steiner Recon lance.

MegaMekLab.
Some bug fixes, and big one is Support Vehicle Construction includes ground, S/M naval, and fixed wing; airship, satellite, and large naval). At last we have a splash screen for MegaMekLab (from the amazing SpOoky777). This completes the linked sets of splash screens. One note on Support Vee's: we still need to work on the Record Sheet printing.

MekHQ.
Ok, we've talked about it a lot and it's here. The Planetary system refactor. See a specific overview on our website for what's changed. We've got bug fixes, some UI improvements, the new Scenario Objectives tool is coming along (more on that soon), a markdown editor, for the AtB players (new and old) have a look at the new AtB Starter Guide by CampaignAnon in the docs folder. Oh, and yes we've add Support Vee support into MekHQ.

How can I help?
