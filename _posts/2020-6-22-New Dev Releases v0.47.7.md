Hi Everyone,
Coming up on a couple of months since our last Development release. It's been an interesting few months, we've seen a massive jump in the number of new players. Megamek as become an option to the [official 2020 WWE Event](https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?v=1210046066019321&ref=watch_permalink).  We've also been able to tease a few of the new ilClan units as well. Watch for more teases in the coming months as we are allowed to post them.

#### MegaMek

Lots of Bug fixes in this release. We are starting to think ahead to the next Stable release hopefully later this summer. We do have some new things, the SirMegaV Buildings for map makers, some small UI improvements (check of the board preview), hundreds of new vehicle sprites, and we sent Princess to an Orienteering class (so improved pathfinding).

#### MegaMekLab

Lots of bug fixes but a few key new features. Printing Protomechs is complete meaning we can now build AND print all the core units. We've added the ability to Export Records directly to PDF which works more efficiently than "Print to PDF". Also lots of new printing options to check in the configuration tab. An important one - variable sized equipment  this is now configured in the equipment tab allowing greater precision.

#### MekHQ

Again bug fixes, but a few new key things. [Command Center](https://megamek.org/2020/06/02/Command-Center.html) follow the link to read about it. A couple of custom tech SPAs. We've added more mnemonics. The groundwork for more personnel options as well. In time we'll have The Sims meetings MekHQ.

**FOR MAC USERS**
There isn't a Mac release and you'll have to use the Unix release. We are having issues with the Gradle packaging scripts and various security settings in MacOS.  We are working on the issue and have no ETA for a fix.
