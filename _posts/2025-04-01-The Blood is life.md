## The Blood is Life

For years we’ve been working hard to improve and expand personnel tracking in MekHQ. From gender, to age; from gunnery to education. Everything down to the personality of your company’s janitor is tracked, recorded, and kept up to date. Because Blake forbid you don’t know that your founder’s brother’s cousin’s nephew’s niece (twice removed) is grouchy on Tuesdays.

Yet we’ve suffered too long under the burden of terrible oversight. Information vital to the running of any successful military campaign. So important one of the Clans named themselves after it. So essential without it the Inner Sphere would crumble in an instant, and everything we’ve come to love would collapse in exsanguinated agony!

That’s right, in 50.05 the Alleles will be aligned and the RH Factors finalized!

Prepare to universally receive: we’re adding blood types to MekHQ. Complete with medically accurate inheritance for all newborns. Never again will you be blighted by the lack of knowledge over whether Lord Commander Barry “Big Beard” Burton has their canonical A-Type blood.

After all, how can you pick your campaign commander if you don’t know their Ketsueki-gata alignment?
