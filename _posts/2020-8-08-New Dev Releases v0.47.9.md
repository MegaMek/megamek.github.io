Hi Everyone,

This is quick turn around from 47.8 which as expected had a couple of major bugs. I'm happy to say that those are killed. But we could have more so....

1)  Make backups of your campaigns and customs.
2)  Always treat each release as a stand alone release and only copy your data forward from older versions.

If you haven't see the list of new stuff in 0.47.8 see [here](https://bg.battletech.com/forums/index.php?topic=70438.0)

#### MegaMek
Bug fixes lots of bug fixes and the implementation of ARTS bays in this release.

#### MegaMekLab
Bug fixes lots of bug fixes and the implementation of ARTS bays in this release.

#### MekHQ.
Yep, you guessed it..bug releases. But we did add the battle damage decals to show on the MekHQ sprites.

**FOR MAC USERS**
There isn't a Mac release and you'll have to use the Unix release. We are having issues with the Gradle packaging scripts and various security settings in MacOS.  We are working on the issue and have no ETA for a fix.
