Hi Everyone,

Time for another dev release and wow is this one got some stuff in it. Before I get to that I need to stress this release is very likely to have bugs and likely some major ones. A reminder of what we've we said for years:

1) Make backups of your campaigns and customs.
2) Always treat each release as a stand alone release and only copy your data forward from older versions.

So on to the new stuff!

#### MegaMek

Lots of bug fixes. We’ve tweaked Saxarba default theme to use grass as the default theme. Speaking of themes the large texture them got an overhaul from Ahne and it looks great. We’ve also added Inclines and cliffs from TacOps.

#### MegaMekLab

Data wise we’ve got new sprites based on the Kickstarter and lots of them are getting the royal (colorized) treatment. Greekfire has helped add Fluff text to a chunk of the 3039 units. We’ve tweaked the frequency that LAMs will appear in the RAT Generator. Ever been stuck coming up with a call sign for your pilot, well use the new Random Call Sign generator.

Did I mention Princess has learned to use arty cannons in direct fire.

Last and in one of the coolest new features ‘Damage Decals’.

#### MekHQ

Lots of work in the back end and bug fixes. We’ve added the Random Callsign generator to MekHQ and phase 1 of the Genealogy overhaul.

**FOR MAC USERS**
There isn't a Mac release and you'll have to use the Unix release. We are having issues with the Gradle packaging scripts and various security settings in MacOS.  We are working on the issue and have no ETA for a fix.
