# New Fluff Image Pack

Hello everyone,

Many of you have asked about a Fluff Pack for MegaMek. However, we face challenges with using line art due to copyright and licensing restrictions. We’ve always admired the impressive quality of new plastic re-sculpts and the artistic talent displayed in painting them. We'd like to create a Fluff Pack using images of officially licensed miniatures from CGL, Iron Wind Metals, Creative Juggernaut, and Monster Fight Club.

For this project, we aim to include:

- Re-sculpts, including modified versions showing variants.
- IWM miniatures using molds that are not Re-sculpts.

We want images that look like they belong in a war book, images that resemble their counterparts on the battlefield or within the universe. They will serve as visual representations in the unit selector and match the style of TRO art.

Contributors' rights will be acknowledged by watermarking the images with the artist’s name, a statement of permission, and a notice that all rights belong to the image owner.
