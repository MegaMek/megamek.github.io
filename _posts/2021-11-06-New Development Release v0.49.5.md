# New Development Release 0.49.5

Welcome all to 0.49.5.

As most are aware 0.49.4 had a very nasty bug when launching MegaMek from MekHQ. In addition to the fix we added a couple of things for MekHQ for this release. Windchild will be along to explain in more detail. Given the short time 0.49.4 was available its release notes still stand [SEE HERE](https://megamek.org/2021/10/30/New-Development-Release-v0.49.4.html)

## Java 11 and the 0.49.x Releases.

We have made the change to Java 11, meaning you'll need to update to use the **0.49.x Development Releases**. As Java is now open source, we recommend [Adoptium Temurin 11](https://adoptium.net/index.html?variant=openjdk11) (the name change is solely a rebrand on their side, and no changes are required if you've already downloaded OpenJDK 11).  We have a help page [for windows](https://github.com/MegaMek/megamek/wiki/Updating-to-OpenJDK) and
[macOS.](https://megamek.org/wiki/mac_issues.html) For Linux, you should be able to user your package manager to install OpenJDK from their repositories.

## MegaMek

Few new sprites and unit fluff and fixes. Plus the fix for the MekHQ whitelist.

## MegaMekLab

No changes since 0.49.5

## MekHQ

0.49.5 sees the addition of the Procreation Module, adding a bunch of new options for procreation, and improving the display in the Campaign Options Dialog. This is the first of the Personnel Modules, a project I'm running to isolate personnel functionality into individual modules on a specific topic, like Procreation, Death, and Retirement. The goal of this project is initially to make the current code easier to bugfix and enhance, but the later modules will be large-scale overhauls (Retirement) or large new features (Death). The next two modules, Marriage and Divorce, are already open, while the third, Death, is in progress.

Otherwise, the RAT options are now their own grouping, as they are not just used in AtB but are also used in the Unit Market and GM Tools.

## MekHQ StratCon Alpha

StratCon has seen a bunch of bugfixes since 0.49.3.

## SOCIAL MEDIA

We are also happy to announce we have an [Official MegaMek Discord](https://discord.gg/u2vJ5U2QpD). It will function like our Slack but gives us better voice support for those who use the [official public servers](https://megamek.games). Also a reminder to drop into the [Slack channel](https://bit.ly/2KSu5yQ) to meet other players and harass the Devs that drop in and out. If Slack isn't your thing check out these Discords with MegaMek channels - [Everything BattleTech](https://discord.gg/gyXMWjT) and [Classic BattleTech](https://discord.gg/D9jFn52).

UlyssesSockdrawer is running a popular Solaris VII campaign on our Discord that is always looking for new players. You can join between cycles, which run on a regular basis. However, it is going on temporary hiatus after this cycle, return date TBA.

## Mac Users

We think we now have a [url=https://megamek.org/wiki/mac_issues.html]workaround for Mac Operating Systems[/url].

## Updating Your Campaign:

1. Make backups of your campaigns and customs.
2. Always treat each release as a stand alone release and only copy your data forward from older versions, never backwards.
3. Do not copy MegaMek saves nor any preference file from a different version.
