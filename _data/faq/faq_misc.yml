- question: "Why isn't XYZ rule or feature implemented yet?"
  answer: |
    MegaMek is a community driven project, with a small, dedicated group of
    contributors. There isn't a developer road map, nor overarching directives
    that say "We are working on this." The developers tend to work on the
    projects that interest them in the moment. If you really want a particular
    feature or rule implemented, then either convince one of the developers
    that your project would be cool or interesting, or go ahead and code it and
    issue a pull request. Also, keep in mind that some things are just too
    complicated and would take considerable development time and knowledge.
- question: "Why is the bot so stupid?"
  answer: |
    The new bot (Princess) is substantially better than the original "Test" bot
    that MegaMek used for years. However, there still may be circumstances
    where the bot is unaware of some rules options or performs poorly in certain
    terrains/conditions. For the best experience, either play against another
    human or don't use unusual settings.
- question: "Are the dice conspiring against me?"
  answer: |
    Short answer: No. Long answer: The dice use the standard Java random number
    generation routines. You can find them described in the Sun documentation.
    The same routine is used for every dice roll in the game. These routines
    have been tested, and they behave as closely as possible to real dice as is
    possible on a computer. To put it another way, every time the virtual die is
    rolled, it stands a one-in-six chance of generating each number, one through
    six, and each roll is independent of previous rolls.
- question: "I keep hearing about looking at the Wiki. Where is the Wiki?!?!"
  answer: |
    That can be found on GitHub [here](https://github.com/MegaMek/megamek/wiki).
