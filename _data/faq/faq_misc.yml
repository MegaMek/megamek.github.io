- question: "Why isn't XYZ rule or feature implemented yet?"
  answer: "MegaMek is a community driven project, with a small, dedicated group of contributors. There isn't a developer roadmap, nor overarching directives that say \"We are working on this.\" The developers tend to work on the projects that interest them in the moment. If you really want a particular feature or rule implemented, then either convince one of the developers that your project would be cool or interesting, or go ahead and code it and issue a pull request. Also, keep in mind that some things are just too complicated and would take considerable development time and knowledge."
- question: "Why is the bot so stupid?"
  answer: "The new bot (Princess) is substantially better than the original \"Test\" bot that MegaMek used for years. However, there still may be circumstances where the bot is unaware of some rules options or performs poorly in certain terrains/conditions. For the best experience, either play against another human or don't use unusual settings."
- question: "Are the dice conspiring against me?"
  answer: "Short answer: No. Long answer: The dice use the standard Java random number generation routines. You can find them described in the Sun documentation. The same routine is used for every dice roll in the game. These routines have been tested, and they behave as closely as possible to real dice as is possible on a computer. To put it another way, every time the virtual die is rolled, it stands a one-in-six chance of generating each number, one through six, and each roll is independent of previous rolls."
