- question: "My MHQ campaign is failing to because it cannot find some of my units. What should I do?"
  answer: |
    As part of ongoing efforts to better organize data, unit names may
    occasionally change. We have added support for backward compatibility for
    unit name changes, but you may occasionally experience this error when you
    update MekHQ. In order to correct your campaign file with the new names, you
    will need to open your campaign file (*.cpnx) in a text editor and correct
    the names for units that cannot be found. More detailed instructions can be
    found [here](https://github.com/MegaMek/megamek/wiki/Name-Issues-with-Units).
- question: "What is Variable Tech Level?"
  answer: |
    This is based on the Tech Progression from Interstellar Operations. As
    equipment is introduced and time passes, it will move from Experimental to
    Standard (common use). When this option is enabled, a unit's tech level is
    determined by the highest technology rating for the year the game is in.
- question: "Why can't I find a particular unit?"
  answer: |
    There are three possibilities:

    1. Check in the Allowed units sections and make sure the year the game takes
       place is set, and the tech level is set to the correct level.
    2. We forgot to add it. Please report it either to the
       [bug tracker](https://github.com/MegaMek/megamek/issues) or the
       [forums](https://bg.battletech.com/forums/index.php/board,29.0.html).
    3. The unit has not yet passed the two months moratorium period since its
       official Record Sheet got released. You will have to wait until that happens.
- question: "Why is a particular unit marked as illegal when it fits the official Record Sheet?"
  answer: |
    That usually indicates that the unit has ferro-fibrous armor and is using
    the old armor rules, superseded by TechManual. Armor is now always rounded
    down, making some units overweight, until a new Record Sheet is released.
- question: "How do I get fluff images to show up?"
  answer: |
    We cannot provide fluff images for units, but if you own PDFs or hard copies
    of the appropriate books, you should be able to create your own fluff images.


    Fluff images need to go into the correct unit type directory within the
    `data/images/fluff` directory. The name of the image must exactly
    match the name in the unit selector. So, if you wanted to add a fluff image
    for the "Sunder SD1-0G", you would need to name the image
    "Sunder SD1-0G.xxx" where xxx is the image extension.
- question: "How do I get record sheets that I can use with a tabletop game?"
  answer: |
    There are a couple of ways to do this depending on if you need a single
    record sheet or want to print out a whole lance or more.


    For a single record sheet, use the File > Export to PDF menu within
    MegaMekLab to print out the currently loaded unit or a unit from a file.


    For multiple record sheets, you can use the \"Queue Units to Print\" menu
    option in MegaMekLab to select multiple units to print out at once. You can
    also print directly from a MUL file that you have saved from the MegaMek
    lobby. Remember to check your print options in the File-Configuration.
