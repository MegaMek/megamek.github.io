- question: "What software do I need to run MegaMek?"
  answer: >
    MegaMek will run on any operating system that can run Java 17
    including Windows, macOS, and Linux. Although it will run on later versions
    of Java, your experience will vary. Starting with the 0.50.x Development
    branch MegaMek will require Java 17 to run. Please
    [see these instructions](https://github.com/MegaMek/megamek/wiki/Updating-to-Adoptium-(Eclipse-Temurin-Open-Source-Java)) for details.
- question: "On a Mac, How do I open up multiple instances of MegaMek?"
  answer: >
    By default, macOS applications will only open a single instance. To open up
    a second instance of MegaMek, you will have to use the Terminal application
    (in Application/Utilities). Navigate to your MegaMek directory and type:

    ```bash
      java -jar MegaMek.jar &
    ```

    The `-n` argument tells macOS to open up a new instance of the application.
- question: "I am on a Mac, and MegaMek will not open up up properly when I click on it. What should I do?"
  answer: >
    Use the `pkg` installer on Adoptium to install either the JRE or JDK version of
    Java you need (17). For example, the
    version for the Apple Silicon (M-Series) Macs can be found [here](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?os=mac&arch=aarch64&version=17).
    Additional information can be found on the [macOS Issues](/wiki/mac_issues.html) page.
- question: "How do I use more, or less, memory?"
  answer: >
    By default, MegaMek uses up to 1024 megabytes (1 gigabyte) of memory.
    This amount of memory is sufficient for most games, but when playing
    large games against the bot, higher amounts of memory can boost
    performance. See our [detailed instructions](https://github.com/MegaMek/megamek/wiki/Increasing-Memory-%28Can-help-with-the-bot%29)
    for how to change memory settings on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- question: "I'm seeing weird artifacts or screen distortions. How do I fix this?"
  answer: >
    Visual glitches like rendering artifacts, screen distortions, or UI scaling
    issues are usually caused by Java's graphics pipeline. These can be fixed
    by adding specific Java flags to your configuration files. See our
    [troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/MegaMek/megamek/wiki/Weird-artifacts-Screen-Distortions)
    for detailed instructions on fixing these display issues.
- question: "Why can't I host a game?"
  answer: >
    If you are hosting a game over the internet, and other people
    cannot connect to your address, then you probably have port
    forwarding disabled in your router. You will need to allow port
    forwarding from the router to your computer on the port that
    MegaMek is using (2346, by default). How to do this will vary
    depending upon what type of set up you have for connecting with
    the internet. Check the instructions for your router. You can also
    try [portforward.com](https://portforward.com), which has
    instructions on how to forward ports for many routers."
- question: "How do I start a dedicated server?"
  answer: >
    Follow our [detailed instructions](wiki/ded_servers.html) for setting
    up a dedicated server on your machine or check out the instructions at
    [MegaMek Games](https://megamek.games) to set one up on a private server.
