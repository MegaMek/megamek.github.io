- question: "What software do I need to run MegaMek?"
  answer: >
    MegaMek will run on any operating system that can run Java 8
    including Windows, macOS, and Linux. Although it will run on later versions
    of Java, your experience will vary. Starting with the 0.49.x Development
    branch MegaMek will require Java 11 to run. Please
    [see these instructions](wiki/adopt_open_java.html) for details.
- question: "On a Mac, How do I open up multiple instances of MegaMek?"
  answer: >
    By default, macOS applications will only open a single instance. To open up
    a second instance of MegaMek, you will have to use the Terminal application
    (in Application/Utilities). Navigate to your MegaMek directory and type:

    ```bash
      java -jar MegaMek.jar &
    ```

    The `-n` argument tells macOS to open up a new instance of the application.
- question: "I am on a Mac, and MegaMek will not open up up properly when I click on it. What should I do?"
  answer: >
    Use the `pkg` installer on Adoptium to install either the JRE or JDK version of
    Java you need (either 11 or 17, 11 is currently recommended). For example, the
    version for the Apple Silicon (M-Series) Macs can be found [here](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?os=mac&arch=aarch64&version=11).
    Additional information can be found on the [macOS Issues](wiki/mac_issues.html) page.
- question: "How do I use more, or less, memory?"
  answer: >
    By default, MegaMek uses up to 1024 megabytes (1 gigabyte) of memory.
    This amount of memory is sufficient for most games, but when playing
    large games against the bot, higher amounts of memory can boost
    performance. How you change the maximum memory allowed varies by
    operating system.


    On Windows, open up the MegaMek.l4j.ini file and change the line that says
    `-Xmx1024m` to the amount of memory you want. For example, if you want
    512 megabytes of memory, you would change this line to `-Xmx512m`.


    On macOS, you want to right-click on the MegaMek icon and choose Show
    Package Contents. Then open up Contents/Info.plist. Look for the line
    that says `-Xmx1024m` and edit this as above.


    On a Linux/Unix system, you will need to edit the startup.sh file's last
    line, or just add the memory argument directly to your java command if
    launching manually. For example:


    ```bash
    java -Xmx512m -jar MegaMek.jar &
    ```
- question: "Why can't I host a game?"
  answer: >
    If you are hosting a game over the internet, and other people
    cannot connect to your address, then you probably have port
    forwarding disabled in your router. You will need to allow port
    forwarding from the router to your computer on the port that
    MegaMek is using (2346, by default). How to do this will vary
    depending upon what type of set up you have for connecting with
    the internet. Check the instructions for your router. You can also
    try [portforward.com](https://portforward.com), which has
    instructions on how to forward ports for many routers."
- question: "How do I start a dedicated server?"
  answer: >
    Follow our [detailed instructions](wiki/ded_servers.html) for setting
    up a dedicated server on your machine or check out the instructions at
    [MegaMek Games](https://megamek.games) to set one up on a private server.
