        Installing Java
      </div>
      <div class='card-body'>
        <p class='card-text'>
          Java is required for use of this program and we recommend using
          Adoptium 17 for current and future versions for best results.
          Starting with the 0.50.0 development release, it will be required.
        </p>
        <p>
          MegaMek should run on any computer that can run Java without much
          issue. Will NOT run on iOS/iPadOS/tvOS/Android devices. You
          experience will vary based on computer specifications.

      <div class='card-body'>
        <p class='card-text'>
          For those of us using macOS, there are some additional things that
          we need to be aware of. We're making this more prominent in hopes
          to reduce the number of questions we get that can be solved by
          going <a href="/wiki/mac_issues.html">here</a>.
        </p>
        <p class='card-text'>
          Make sure Adoptium 17 is installed. Recommended way is in the link
          above.
        </p>
        <p class='card-text'>
          Make sure the decompressed files are <em><strong>NOT</strong></em>
          in the <strong>Documents</strong>, <strong>Downloads</strong>,
          or <strong>Desktop</strong> folders. These are
          <em><strong>protected</strong></em> folders and macOS will not
          let it run.

          To run the programs from Windows, just double-click on the given
          program icon from within the folder you unzipped.
        </p>
        <p class='card-text'>
          Depending on how Java is setup on your machine, you may also be able
          to double click on the JAR files themselves vs the EXE. No real
          difference between the two other than possible launching experience.

        <p class='card-text'>
          The Unix/Linux releases do not include application binaries, but
          you can run the programs directly from the included JAR files. On
          some desktops, you may just be able to double-click these JAR
          files in order to run the programs. you can also run the programs
          (MegaMek, in the example below) from the command line with the
          command:

        <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge">
          <div>
            <pre class="highlight"><code>java <span class="nt">-jar</span> MegaMek.jar &amp;</code></pre>

        Updating Between Versions
      </div>
      <div class='card-body'>
        <p class='card-text'>
          When updating between versions, it is important to always use a
          new folder for the new version, make backups of all campaigns and
          custom files, and <strong><em>COPY</em></strong> campaigns and
          custom files to the new folder. Updating to a newer version is
          <strong><em>NOT</em></strong> backwards compatible and could
          break things.

        <p class='card-text'>
          We recommend that most users download and use the milestone version of
          the programs to minimize issues with bugs. The development versions
          are only for those users interested in testing and bug hunting new
          features.

          To install the programs, unzip the download into the directory of

          instructions below.

        <p>
          On Windows, do <strong>NOT</strong> use the built in utility for
          decompression zip files as it has been known to cause issues.
